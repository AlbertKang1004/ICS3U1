// File: Bugs3.java

public class bugs3

{

   public static void main(String args[])

   {

      System.out.println("Bugs are frustrating. );

   }

}

[Fixed]
Line 3: Class' name should be the same with file's name -> public class Bugs3
Line 11: need quotation mark(") at the end of the string -> System.out.println("Bugs are frustrating. ");
